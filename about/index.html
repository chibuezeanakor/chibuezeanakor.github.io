                My name is Chibueze Anakor, but I'm known to many people as Chris. I am an aspiring Software Engineer hwo has had a keen intreest in technology ever since childhood. This early curiosity led me to explore the ins and outs of how to operate many different devices, suhc as video game consoles, televiisons, and PDAs. In high school, I decided that I wnated to create software, and began working toward being able to do so by learning Java. In college, I wanted to continue developing software, so I had continued my studies with Java, in addition to learning Python, SQL, JavaScript, and Ruby. I am currently an intern with Capital One through the Year Up program, which is a one-year professional development program that helps young adults succeed in corporate environments.
